                <h2>My Journey into the Cosmos</h2>
                <p>My fascination with the night sky began during a childhood camping trip in the Rocky Mountains. Away from city lights, I saw the Milky Way for the first time and was instantly captivated. That experience sparked a lifelong passion for astronomy.</p>
                
                <p>I received my first telescope as a birthday gift at age 14—a modest 4.5-inch reflector. While the views were <em>humbling and inspiring</em>, I wanted to share what I was seeing with others. That desire led me to astrophotography.</p>
                
                <p>For the past eight years, I've been honing my skills in capturing the night sky. What I love most about this hobby is how it combines technical challenges with artistic expression. Each successful image feels like a personal achievement and a connection to the universe.</p>

                <h2>Biggest Challenges in Astrophotography</h2>
                <p>Astrophotography comes with unique obstacles that make each successful image particularly rewarding:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Light Pollution:</strong> Finding truly dark skies often requires traveling far from cities</li>
                    <li><strong>Weather:</strong> Clouds can ruin weeks of planning in minutes</li>
                    <li><strong>Technical Complexity:</strong> Equipment requires precise alignment and calibration</li>
                    <li><strong>Patience:</strong> Some targets require 20+ hours of total exposure time</li>
                    <li><strong>Cost:</strong> Quality equipment represents a significant investment</li>
                </ul>
